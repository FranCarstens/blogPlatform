#[Blog Platform.](https://lebloge.herokuapp.com/#login)

Blog Platform provides a minimalist blogging experience. Aimed at individual bloggers functionality includes an "all blogs" view as well as a discover option.

Built on the Maestro full stack starter kit. Blog Platform was built using HMTL5, Sass, Javascript, React with Flux, Backbone, Express, Mongoose and MongoDB.

Blog Platform started as a weekend assignment for *The Iron Yard*. This project is incomplete and may lack certain features.
